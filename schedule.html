                It started with Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games and now we have augmented reality, virtual 
                reality, and Decentraland. We are altering the way that we use technology on a daily basis and with the 
                onset of Web 3 technologies, are we really prepared personally and/or professionally to meet the coming 
                challenges? In this presentation, we will explore some of the hot topics and challenges that are being 
                observed through reporting in this space. It is the hope of the presenter to open up the floor for conversations 
                in the conference in how we can address these challenges now so that we can be ahead of the threats in the future.

                In "Chasing Cyber's Tail" we'll discuss the reason some organizations constantly find themselves behind 
                attackers in their environment by constantly chasing the latest IOCs and how leaders can adapt their current 
                threat intelligence focuses to cast a better net for attacker behavior in their environment, giving their team 
                a chance to head attackers off. We'll investigate how summiting even one or two rungs of the Pyramid of Pain 
                can pay dividends for creating a proactive hunting program and look at real world examples from ransomware 
                groups for the difference in outcomes that follows shifting focusing on IOCs and TTPs in an environment.

                This talk is geared to those seeking to make Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) actionable through emulation 
                and detection engineering. In the discussion, we will cover the expansion of David Bianco's Pyramid of 
                Pain, the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) Pyramid. We will cover a brief history of cyber 
                intelligence, its evolution, and how MITRE ATT&CK fits in. We then will show what each level is 
                representative of and how it can be leveraged. Finally, we will highlight what getting to the procedure 
                level means, along with how to use procedural level intelligence in an actionable manner effectively.

                Today’s organizations face unprecedented challenges in battling cyber threats. Between increasingly 
                sophisticated cybercriminals, rapidly expanding digital assets and attack surfaces, and a legal landscape 
                that threatens to punish those companies that fail to adequately protect their customers’ privacy rights, 
                it’s not hard to see why cybersecurity professionals are buckling under the mounting pressure. Within this 
                complex new cyber threat battleground, organizations cannot afford to continue relying on passive, reactive 
                defense, and instead, must leverage the tools and methodologies to facilitate a truly proactive and 
                preemptive cyber defensive program. Threat hunting is a powerful tool enabling companies to take a proactive 
                approach to build organizational cyber resilience. By seeking out the highest-priority potential cyber 
                threats rather than waiting for evidence of them to appear, threat hunting provides a proven, systematic 
                way for an organization to defend itself from the most concerning risks, reducing dwell times and 
                accelerating remediation and response. This session is an in-depth technical demonstration of the threat 
                hunting process on the deep and dark web which will demonstrate new techniques and innovative threat hunting 
                tools that empower organizations to proactively block threats before they can materialize into catastrophic 
                cyber incidents. Michael-Angelo Zummo, Senior Threat Intel Specialist at Cybersixgill, will demonstrate 
                the best practices for performing an effective threat hunt.

                Much like the human body, organizations are complex systems that live and breathe. In order to stay healthy 
                and at our full potential, our bodies have evolved a robust and some-times anti-fragile immune system. The 
                system uses filtration, identification of invaders, anti-bodies, T-cells, white-blood cells, and even blood 
                clotting. These tools work in harmonic unison to defend against outside invaders getting access to our core 
                systems, as well as search and destroy anything inside of our bodies that is meant to do us harm. As security 
                practitioners and security leaders, it is our sole purpose to ensure the immune system of our organizations 
                are operating at the highest possible level. It is not a question of will a cyberthreat become viable inside 
                of the environment you protect, but when. Your ultimate success is directly tied to the short term and long 
                term health of the security "immune" systems in place to keep your organization safe from harm. In this talk 
                we'll explore the parallels between the human immune system and cybersecurity threat detection/response 
                systems - with the goal of giving you a new way to look at the future of cybersecurity inside of your 
                organization.

                the seeds of anarchy, horrify seasoned CISOs, and stop indiscriminate link-clickers in their trackballs.

                This presentation will show you how to secure an organization's data in cloud. The focus will be on 
                preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the platform and the data contained within. 
                The presentation will also address governance, risk management and compliance for organizations that have 
                the requirements of a security framework.

                Many people have probably heard of the “SANS Top 20”, the old name for the Critical Security Controls, properly 
                the CIS Controls.  Thing is, they aren’t managed by SANS (since 2013), and with the latest version (8, out in 2021) 
                are no longer 20!  But do you know what they are?  How they can be used in building or assessing your security 
                program?

                Security teams are constantly burnt out due to the unlimited amount of investigation and operational tasks. It becomes 
                essential for the security defense team to leverage automation to improve the efficiency of the SOC. In this talk, 
                I would like to share:

                Externally, information security can be perceived as exclusively about penetration testing, threat hunting, incident 
                response, or security policy. However, there are countless possible careers, many of which remain unfilled. As security 
                goes from a compliance requirement to a competitive advantage, enterprise software companies and their customers must consider 
                their security as a product. Prioritizing what is most valuable to customers given resource constraints and thinking about 
                security strategically are some of the elements a product mindset brings. Even if organizations buy vs. build, they must 
                ensure all the pieces work together. Transitioning to security as an existing product manager or becoming a product manager 
                focused on security takes some adjustment. Essential skills are needed to be a product manager, which can be relevant across 
                many other professions. With those skills and guidance on navigating the information security industry, many professionals 
                can make the transition and bridge this less known talent gap.

                In this presentation, I’ll be covering a wide range of topics on how to build a successful home lab. Topics 
                include, Hardware, Networking, Virtualization, Network Monitoring IDS/IPS, Vulnerability Management, Firewalls, 
                Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools, and Virtual Machines. The slides will include links for 
                the audience who is interested in learning about the tool or equipment and how they can obtain it. With all these 
                topics, the audience will have an in-depth knowledge of tools and equipment they can select when building a home 
                lab and showcase to future employers. Having a home lab is crucial for advancing your career in Cybersecurity. 
                It is also a great way to gain the hands-on experience and talking points needed to succeed at job interviews. 
                The goal is to help people get into Cybersecurity and go above and beyond on their career.
